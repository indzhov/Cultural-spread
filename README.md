# The aims of the project : 
- To prove the hypothesis that the migration of the population has started from the middle east. 
- To visualize the pattern in the migration of the world by the time. 
- To calculate the coefficient of cultural significance per country .
- To Analyze the UNESCO sites and their different types. 
- To compare the different countries by their coefficient of cultural significance. 
- To see where my own country stands in the comparisson (e.g Bulgaria)
- To prove the hypothesis that Bulgaria is a crossroad between different cultures. 
- To prove that the Bulgaria stands like a wall between the Europe and the Middle East in this crossroad. 
- To analyze and try to find the answers behind some questions that may arise .

The pattern in the attention to particular category of sites or overall. 
The interesting thing here is the peak that could been spot. It is the highiest one and it countiniously grow to the begining of the 21 Century, where is its highest point. After some research. the explanation is evident :

"The explanation about the peak for the beginning of 21 century: Shortly after the publication of the 1987 Bruntland Report,which established that development was supported by three pillars -economy, society and environment -the linkages between culture and development was further demonstrated by the United Nations launch of the World Decade for Cultural Development (1988-1997), whose defining Page 2achievement was the report titled Our Creative Diversity,produced for UNESCO by an independent Commission chaired by J. PÃ©rez de Cuellar in 1995. However itwas not untilthe Stockholm Conference on Cultural Policies for Development in 1998 and the Johannesburg World Summit onSustainable Development held in 2002 that culture was acknowledged as the fourth pillar of sustainable development alongside economic, social and environmental factors."
