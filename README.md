This is a GIS project, which is trying to prove a hypothesis or just find a more information about the culture significance of the areas world wide. 
For the reason, are used three different data sets, as one of them is from a Global project and a another one is from the Public Dataset of UNESCO.
They are including the Geographical information in the form of a longitude and latitude. 

# The aims of the project : 
- To prove the hypothesis that the migration of the population has started from the middle east. 
- To visualize the pattern in the migration of the world by the time. 
- To calculate the coefficient of cultural significance per country .
- To Analyze the UNESCO sites and their different types. 
- To compare the different countries by their coefficient of cultural significance. 
- To see where my own country stands in the comparisson (e.g Bulgaria)
- To prove the hypothesis that Bulgaria is a crossroad between different cultures. 
- To prove that the Bulgaria stands like a wall between the Europe and the Middle East in this crossroad.
