# Cultural-spread
This is a GIS project, which is trying to prove a hypothesis or just find a more information about the culture significance of the areas world wide. 
For the reason, are used three different data sets, as one of them is from a Global project and a another one is from the Public Dataset of UNESCO.
They are incluting the Geographical information in the form of a longitude and latitude.
